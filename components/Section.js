                Companies are faced with many options when deciding on a database management system. Discover the key differences between PostgreSQL vs. Oracle that will help you make an informed decision.
Types of Database Management Systems
Database management systems can be categorized as open-sourced or closed-source systems. Open-source means that anyone can download and modify the source code of the database technology for free. Closed-source means that the source code is private and inaccessible to everyone except the developers and authorized parties. You often need to pay a license fee to use closed-source software.

Open-sourced software has an active community of users and developers who can check the code for bugs, extend the software’s functionality, and often provide support for the solution. You have greater flexibility with open-sourced software, as you can customize it based on your company’s needs and have access to a large community for development resources.

Closed-source software offers less flexibility compared to open-source solutions, but it can make up for that through premium support options on-hand for emergencies, extensive training, and documentation resources, enterprise-grade security and stability, and less decision-making on the software versions to implement.

You can also find overlap between closed-source and open-source capabilities. For example, closed-source software may provide an add-on framework that allows third-party developers to extend functionality, while some open-source software can provide access to paid support solutions.

Key Differences Between PostgreSQL and Oracle
When you look at PostgreSQL vs. Oracle database management systems, the main difference between these two databases is that PostgreSQL is an open-source database, while Oracle is a closed database system. PostgreSQL is a free relational object-oriented database management system that is developed by volunteer developers worldwide. Oracle is a licensed commercial relational database management system.

Both database systems use similar concepts such as schemas, tablespaces and indices, but they diverge in areas such as replication and support. Let’s explore the ways that these two database systems handle vital operations.

Functionality
 
PostgreSQL

High availability
Four levels of transactions: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable
ACID-compliant
 

Oracle

High availability
Higher transactions per second
More functional than PostgreSQL, but these functions come at a price premium
ACID-compliant
Scalability
 
PostgreSQL

More scalable due to its open-source characteristics
Databases accommodate any volume of data
Cluster-based storage solutions allow for free expansion
Foster integrity during scalability operations with WAL files, although these files are limited to 16 MB
 

Oracle

Have to spend more on infrastructure to carry out scalability operations, as the Standard edition only has four sockets, while the Enterprise edition offers more
Maintain data integrity with redo logs
